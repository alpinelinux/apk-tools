# GLOBAL OPTIONS

The following options are available for all commands.

*-f, --force*
	Enable selected --force-\* options (deprecated).

*-i, --interactive*
	Ask confirmation before performing certain operations.
	Interactive mode can be made the default when running on a tty,
	by creating /etc/apk/interactive as an empty file.

*-p, --root* <_ROOT_>
	Manage file system at _ROOT_.

*-q, --quiet*
	Print less information.

*-U, --update-cache*
	Alias for '--cache-max-age 1'.

*-v, --verbose*
	Print more information (can be specified twice).

*-V, --version*
	Print program version and exit.

*-X, --repository* <_REPO_>
	Specify additional package repository. This option can be specified
	multiple times.

*--allow-untrusted*
	Install packages with untrusted signature or no signature.

*--arch* _ARCH_
	Temporarily override architecture, to be combined with --root.

*--cache-dir* _CACHEDIR_
	Temporarily override the cache directory. _CACHEDIR_ is treated relative
	to the _ROOT_.

*--cache-max-age* _AGE_
	Maximum AGE (in minutes) for index in cache before it's refreshed.

*--force-binary-stdout*
	Continue even if binary data will be printed to the terminal.

*--force-broken-world*
	Continue even if _world_ cannot be satisfied.

*--force-non-repository*
	Continue even if packages may be lost on reboot. This can happen when
	running in run-from-tmpfs mode, and installing non-repository package.

*--force-old-apk*
	Continue even if packages use unsupported features.

*--force-overwrite*
	Overwrite files in other packages.

*--force-refresh*
	Do not use cached files (local or from proxy).

*--keys-dir* _KEYSDIR_
	Override directory of trusted keys. This is treated relative to _ROOT_.

*--no-cache*
	Do not use any local cache path.

*--no-check-certificate*
	Do not validate the HTTPS server certificates.

*--no-interactive*
	Disable interactive mode.

*--no-network*
	Do not use the network. The cache is still used when possible.

*--no-progress*
	Disable progress bar even for TTYs.

*--print-arch*
	Print default arch and exit.

*--progress*
	Show progress.

*--progress-fd* _FD_
	Write progress to the specified file descriptor.

*--purge*
	Purge modified configuration and cached packages. Enables deletion of
	modified configuration files on package removal. On cache clean action
	this enables deletion of unneeded cached packages (uninstalled packages
	on tmpfs installations or all packages on disk installations).

*--repositories-file* _REPOFILE_
	Override system repositories, see *apk-repositories*(8). Specifying this
	option overrides the normal repositories file and repositories.d directory
	processing. The given _REPOFILE_ is relative to the startup directory since
	apk 2.12.0_rc2.

*--wait* _TIME_
	Wait for TIME seconds to get an exclusive repository lock before
	failing.

# COMMIT OPTIONS

The following options are available for all commands which commit the database.

*-s, --simulate*
	Simulate the requested operation without making any changes. The database
	is opened in read only mode, and auto-updating of indexes is disabled.
	You may want to run "apk update" before running a simulation to make sure
	it is done with up-to-date repository indexes.

*--clean-protected*
	Do not create .apk-new files in configuration directories.

*--overlay-from-stdin*
	Read list of overlay files from stdin. Normally this is used only during
	initramfs when booting run-from-tmpfs installation.

*--no-scripts*
	Do not execute any scripts. Useful for extracting a system image for
	different architecture on alternative _ROOT_.

*--no-commit-hooks*
	Skip pre/post hook scripts (but not other scripts).

*--initramfs-diskless-boot*
	Used by initramfs when it's recreating root tmpfs. This enables selected
	force options to minimize failure, and disables commit hooks, among
	other features.
